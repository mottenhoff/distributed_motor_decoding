Code used to generate the results of the manuscript (link will follow).

## Installation

Tested for python 3.9, but other versions will likely work as well.

`conda create --name your_env_name python=3.9`\
`conda activate your_env_name`\
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

For the main results: \
`python decode.py`

For cross task:\
`python cross_task.py`
